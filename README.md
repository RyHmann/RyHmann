# Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ryan. I've worked for the past 10 years as an electrical engineer designing sports stadiums :building_construction:. It was incredibly fun, rewarding, and challenging. That being said, I've always had this *thing* with computers... I always thought programming is just so **cool**. Finally, during my move from the US to New Zealand, I decided to pursue my dreams. I hung up my t-square (well Revit and CAD software) and I've been soaking up as much info on programming as I can. This has led to "traditional" self-taught routes (Helloooo Pluralsight, Youtube tutorials, etc) to places I never thouogh I'd be (section leader for Stanford's CS106A: Code in Place!). 

It's been a scary, rewarding, fun, and stressful time. I love learning, so right now even though it kind of feels like I committed career Hari-kari, it feels like I'm where I'm supposed to be :house:.
