# Oh, hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ryan. I've worked for the past 10 years as an electrical engineer designing sports stadiums :building_construction:. That was super fun, but I've recently wanted to pivot and work in a field that matches my passion: Software Development! I've hung up my T-Square (well ok Revit and AutoCAD ), aquired part-time work to keep me afloat, and I'm studying as much as I can in the meantime.

## About me
### Work
* I'm currently self-teaching full-time
* I helped design and launch a small business website
* I have 10 years of experience as an Electrical Engineer designing professional and collegiate sports stadia, arena, and ballparks. I left this position when I moved from Denver CO to Wellington NZ

### Projects
* My current project is The Pantry, it's an application that allows you to search my database for recipes based on ingredients you input.
* I'm currently searching for open source projects to contribute to.
