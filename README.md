### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ryan. I've worked for the past 10 years as an electrical engineer designing sports stadiums. That was super fun, but I've recently wanted to pivot and work in a field that matches my passion: Software Development! I've hung up my T-Square (well ok Revit and AutoCAD), aquired part-time work to keep me afloat, and I'm studying as much as I can in the meantime.
