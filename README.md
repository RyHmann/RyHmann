I'm Ryan. I've worked for the past 10 years as an electrical engineer designing sports stadiums :building_construction:. It was incredibly fun, rewarding, and challenging. That being said, I've always had this *thing* with computers... I always thought programming is just so **cool**. Finally, during my move from the US to New Zealand, I decided to pursue my dream:. I hung up my t-square (well Revit and CAD software) and I've been soaking up as much info on programming as I can. This has led to "traditional" self-taught routes (Helloooo Pluralsight, Youtube tutorials, etc) to places I never thought I'd be (section leader for Stanford's CS106A: Code in Place!), or interning for an international software company.

It's been a scary, rewarding, fun, and stressful time. I love learning, so right now even though it kind of feels like I committed career Hari-kari, it feels like I'm where I'm supposed to be :house:.

## About me
### Work
* I'm currently working as a junior developer, mainly in the backend of a c# application
* I was fortunate to be selected as a section leader for Code in Place: Stanford's online offering of their Intro to Computer Sciecne course
* I helped design and launch a small business website
* I have 10 years of experience as an Electrical Engineer designing professional and collegiate sports stadia, arena, and ballparks. I left this position when I moved from Denver CO to Wellington NZ

### Projects
* My current project is The Pantry, it's an application that allows you to search my database for recipes based on ingredients you input.
* I'm currently searching for open source projects to contribute to.
